## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

lab 7, part 1
This was one of my favorite labs since it had to do with conditional statements and being allowed to chain && and || into a longer statement to fill out the requirements of parking times. Even though there might have been a better more efficient way to handle the if statements, it was still enjoyable to process the time constraints each one had and make the statement match it. Overall, this lab was fun to work on, and making filling out the requirements kinda felt game-like in making sure that each one was correct and making sure that I had every requirement done correctly.

lab 8, part 2


I found this lab very enjoyable since it was our first time working with nested for loops and being able to visually see how and what they did gave me a good visual. It took a moment to understand that nested for loops worked in a more 2D visual so being able to work with that and mess around with it really helped me understand the capabilities of for loops. Being able to work with nested for loops was really enjoyable and educational.

lab 10, part 1
Even though this lab was short and was done by myself, I still enjoyed this lab since I was able to get more experience using ranged-based loops since I had only really been using them for loops. Working with ranged-based loops gave me an understanding of how they worked and how they could be used. Using these types of loops really gave me more insight into how they can be done and showed me how much easier it could be to write in loops.
